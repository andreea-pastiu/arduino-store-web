# arduino-store-web

Description

The project simulates an online shop that sells items for Arduino projects.

Features

The application uses two types of accounts: users and administrators. It also features different categories of products. Each category which extends the Product class has fields specific to that category. After logging in, users have the option to see the products from each category, add them to the cart and save the order. The administrators see a different page where they can add and delete products.
